Beginning Ruby Exercises
========================

A small set of Ruby exercises aimed at beginning programmers learning Ruby.
Written for one of my students at [The Firehose
Project](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/).

Write solutions to exercises in [exercises.rb](exercises.rb). My solutions are
available in [exercises_solutions.rb](exercises_solutions.rb).


## Checking your solutions
Find out if your solutions are correct by running the tests. These can be run
for individual exercises using using `run_test.sh`:

	$ ./run_test.sh 3

The above command will run the tests for exercise 3.

After completing the exercises, all the tests can be run using the spec file
directly:

	$ ruby exercises_spec.rb
